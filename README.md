Automation: Python scripts are frequently used to automate tasks like scraping data from websites, managing server configurations, and more.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   1.Download Python Installer:
   -Visit the official Python website.-Download the latest version of Python for Windows.

   2.Run the Installer:
   -Open the downloaded installer file.-Ensure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
   -Choose the "Install Now" option for a straightforward installation. Alternatively, you can select "Customize installation" to choose optional features.

   3.Installation Process:
   -The installer will handle the installation process, including setting up the Python executable and other necessary files.
   -Once the installation is complete, you will see a "Setup was successful" message.

   4.Verifying Python Installation
   -Open Command Prompt:Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.
   -Verify Installation:
   -Type python --version or python -V and press Enter. You should see the installed version of Python printed in the command prompt.
   -To check if pip (Python's package installer) is installed, type pip --version. This should also display the version of pip installed.

   5.Setting Up a Virtual Environment
   Install Virtual Environment Package:
   -If not already installed, you can install the venv module by typing pip install virtualenv in the Command Prompt.
   Create a Virtual Environment:
   -Navigate to your project directory using cd path\to\your\project.
   -Create a virtual environment by typing python -m venv myenv. Here, myenv is the name of your virtual environment.
   Activate the Virtual Environment:
   -On Windows, activate the virtual environment by typing myenv\Scripts\activate. You should see (myenv) appear at the beginning of your command prompt line, indicating that the virtual environment is active.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   -In the command prompt:
   python hello_world.py

   -This program uses Python's built-in print function to display the string "Hello, World!" on the console.

   -Running a .py file in the console is the process of executing a Python script using the Python interpreter, which reads the code in the file and performs the specified operations.It also indicates a file contains Python code.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python.
   
    Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
    1. Integers (int)
    Description: Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

    x = 10
    y = -5
    print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

    2.Floating-Point Numbers (float)Description: Numbers that contain decimal points or are in exponential form.
    x = 10.5
    y = -3.14
    z = 2.5e3  # Equivalent to 2500.0
    print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'float'>

    3.Strings (str)
    Description: Sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (").

    greeting = "Hello, World!"
    name = 'Alice'
    print(type(greeting))  # Output: <class 'str'>

    4.Tuples (tuple)
    Description: Ordered collections of items similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed). Enclosed in parentheses (()).

    point = (3, 4)
    person = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")
    print(type(point))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. 
   -Conditional Statements:if, if-else, and elif are used to execute code based on conditions.
   Enable decision-making and control the flow of the program.

   -for loop iterates over sequences, while while loop repeats as long as a condition is true.
   
   Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   if-else statement:
   b = 20
   if b > 30:
    print("b is greater than 30")
    else:
    print("b is not greater than 30")

    for loop:
    furniture = ["stool", "table", "chair"]
    for furniture in fruits:
    print(furniture)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? 
   A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. 

   1.Modularity- Allows one to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, making the code more organized and modular.

   2.Abstraction-Makes it posssibe for one to hide the implementation details and expose only the necessary interface.

   3.Testing and Debugging-Functions can be tested individually, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.
   
   
   Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   def add_numbers(a, b):

   return a + b

   result = add_numbers(50, 100)

   print("The sum is:", result)

   The sum is: 150

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python.

   a.Lists are ordered collections accessed by index, allow duplicate elements, and are enclosed in square brackets [ ] while  Dictionaries are unordered collections accessed by keys, keys must be unique, values can be duplicated, and they are enclosed in curly braces { } with key-value pairs separated by colons :.

   b.Use lists when you have a collection of items that need to be ordered and accessed by their position while Use dictionaries when you have a collection of data that needs to be retrieved quickly using descriptive keys rather than numeric indices.

   c.Lists have elements are accessed using integer indices starting from 0 while dictionarys have elements that are accessed using keys (which can be of any immutable type like strings or integers).

   d.Lists can contain duplicate values and different data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.) while dictionarys have keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated and can be of any data type.
   
   Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Input:
   # Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "occupation": "Engineer"
}

# Print initial list and dictionary
print("Initial list of numbers:", numbers)
print("Initial dictionary:", person)

# Accessing elements
first_number = numbers[0]
person_name = person["name"]

print("First number in the list:", first_number)
print("Name of the person:", person_name)

# Adding new elements
numbers.append(6)
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

print("List after adding a number:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after adding an email:", person)

# Modifying existing elements
numbers[1] = 10
person["age"] = 31

print("List after modifying:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after modifying age:", person)

# Deleting elements
del numbers[2]
person.pop("occupation")

print("List after deletion:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after popping occupation:", person)

# Iterating through elements
print("Iterating through list:")
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

print("Iterating through dictionary:")
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python?
   It is a Python mechanism that allows you to manage and respond to errors or exceptional situations that occur during program execution.
   Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 300 / 0  # Division by zero error

    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print("Error:", e)

    finally:
    # Code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred
    print("Cleanup code")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python.
   Modules in Python are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables. They help organize code into reusable units and facilitate modular programming while Packages are directories containing multiple modules. 
   
    How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
    # main.py
    from my_package import math_operations
    from my_package.utils import file_operations
    result_add = math_operations.add(5, 3)
    file_operations.read_file("data.txt")print("Addition result:", result_add)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python?
    1.Reading from a File:
    Use open() with 'r' mode.
    Methods: read(), readline(), readlines().
    2.Writing to a File:
    Use open() with 'w' mode.
    Methods: write(), writelines().
    3.Closing Files:
    Always close files using close() to free up resources.
    Use with statement for automatic resource management.
    
     Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
     1.
     # Define the file path
file_path = 'sample.txt'  # Replace with your file path

# Open the file in read mode
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the entire content of the file
        content = file.read()
        
        # Print the content to the console
        print("File content:")
        print(content)
        
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: Permission denied to access the file '{file_path}'.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: Failed to read the file '{file_path}'. {e}")

    2.
    # List of strings
lines = [
    "Hello, this is line 1.\n",
    "This is line 2.\n",
    "And this is line 3.\n"
]

# File path
file_path = 'output.txt'

# Open the file in write mode ('w')
with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    # Write each line from the list to the file
    file.writelines(lines)

print(f"Lines have been written to '{file_path}' successfully.")
